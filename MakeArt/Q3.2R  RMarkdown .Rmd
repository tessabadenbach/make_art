# How to use the make_art() Function

### Creating a random artwork

The make_art() function creates random artworks from three different templates. 
To get a random artwork, you just have  to call the function: make_art()

Then you should see an artwork like this: 
![art](/Users/theresabadenbach/Desktop/myartwork1.png)

### Creating a reproducible artwork

If you want to create a reproducible image, you just need insert an argument when calling the function.
For example, you can call make_art(100). Then you will get the same image every time you call make_art(100).
